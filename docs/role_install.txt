# Ansible Galaxy can install from a tar.gz file. 
# However, it needs to be told to install in the 
# /etc/ansible/roles directory, and to remove the 
# '.tar.gz' from the role name.
# In the command below:
#   -p /etc/ansible/roles     # Install in the default.
#   ansible_apache_stig.tar.gz
#   ,,                        # Yes, two commas.
#   <org_name>.apache_stig    # What the role will be.
ansible-galaxy install -p /etc/ansible/roles ansible_apache_stig.tar.gz,,<org_name>.apache_stig

# Copy the 'apache_stig.yml' file from the role to your
# playbook area. Edit the file to reference the role name,
# <org_name>.apache_stig. Then run the playbook.
