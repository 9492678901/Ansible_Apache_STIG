## Using Tags.

# Tags provide a way to run, or to skip, certain parts
# of a playbook. 

# This would run ONLY things tagged with "cat2":

  ansible-playbook apache_stig.yml -K --tags "cat2"


# This would run everything BUT those tagged with "cat2":

  ansible-playbook apache_stig.yml -K --skip-tags "cat2"


# With the exact same playbooks, this would run everything,
# tagged or not:

  ansible-playbook apache_stig.yml -K
