# install_ansible_apache_stig.txt

# This file comes bundled with two tar.gz files.

# Install Ansible
# ===============
#
# As root, in a tmp directory with sufficient space:

    tar -xzvf ansible_rpms.tar.gz 
    cd ansible_rpms
    yum -y install *.rpm
    rm ../ansible_rpms.tar.gz



# Install the Ansible Role
# ========================
#
# As root, in a tmp directory with sufficient space (~70M):

  ansible-galaxy install -p /etc/ansible/roles ansible_apache_stig.tar.gz,,<org_name>.apache_stig
  
# As the sudo enabled user, 
#   Create an Ansible work space and 'playbooks' directory 
#     in your home space.
#   Move into the Ansible directory and copy the playbook from the role.
#   If needed, edit defaults/main.yml.
#   Run the playbook.

  mkdir -p ansible/playbooks
  cd ansible
  cp /etc/ansible/roles/<org_name>.apache_stig/apache_stig.yml playbooks
  ansible-playbook playbooks/apache_stig.yml -K


# At this point Ansible and Apache are installed.
# Apache is STIG'd.



### Extra detail
### ============

# Ansible Galaxy
# ==============

# Ansible Galaxy can install from a tar.gz file. 
# However, it needs to be told to install in the 
# /etc/ansible/roles directory, and to remove the 
# '.tar.gz' from the role name.
# In the command below:
#   -p /etc/ansible/roles     # Install in the default.
#   ansible_apache_stig.tar.gz
#   ,,                        # Yes, two commas.
#   <org_name>.apache_stig    # What the role will be. 

ansible-galaxy install -p /etc/ansible/roles ansible_apache_stig.tar.gz,,<org_name>.apache_stig

# So you wind up with:

#  /etc/ansible/roles/<org_name>.apache_stig/



# Tags
# ====

# Tags provide a way to run, or to skip, certain parts
# of a playbook. 

# This would run ONLY things tagged with "cat2":

  ansible-playbook apache_stig.yml -K --tags "cat2"

# This would run everything BUT those tagged with "cat2":

  ansible-playbook apache_stig.yml -K --skip-tags "cat2"

# With the exact same playbooks, this would run everything,
# tagged or not:

  ansible-playbook apache_stig.yml -K
